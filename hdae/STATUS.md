# HDAE Status

## Recovery checkpoint

- Active skill: `hdae-development`
- Skill path: `.agents/skills/hdae-development/SKILL.md`
- Reload after context shift: required
- Active project: native controller desktop
- Branch: `codex/controller-desktop`
- Intended base: `main` at `759cf2e2`
- Active gate: Gate 30, controller desktop qualification and documentation
- Status: Gates 19–29 closed; Gate 30 starting
- Last evidence: Gate 29 passed `make test-controller-desktop-recovery`,
  `make test-controller-desktop-stress`, `make check`, and `git diff --check`;
  implementation commit `f71d89ad`
- Open decisions or limitations: none inside Gate 19; GPU acceleration, raw GPU
  passthrough, and broad desktop compatibility are deferred
- Exact next action: define measured responsiveness budgets, add integrated
  desktop qualification and performance harnesses, run the clean full suite,
  audit QEMU cleanup and documentation, and reconcile Gates 19–30

## Governing outcome

Ginux owns the physical display/input seat and presents a native ring-3
controller desktop. Native applications use a Ginux protocol; Linux domains run
their own Wayland environment and export one desktop surface that can be
windowed or full screen. The CLI remains the recovery path.

## Repository notes

Gates 1–12 and their inserted sub-gates remain locked historical records.
Unrelated open Gates 13–18 are preserved unchanged; this approved batch begins
at the next available integer and does not claim their completion.
