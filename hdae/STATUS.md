# HDAE Status

## Recovery checkpoint

- Active skill: `.agents/skills/hdae-development/SKILL.md`
- Reload required after compaction, reset, resume, or handoff: yes
- Active project: feedback-driven kernel hardening
- Branch: `codex/feedback-hardening`
- Baseline tag: `research-v1-baseline`
- Active gate: Gate 11, matched UP and SMP benchmark matrix, blocked on a
  human scope decision
- Last completed action: completed every fixed one-thread cell at 1, 2, and 4
  vCPUs; scaled 2-vCPU/2-thread CPU samples passed, but its shared-memory
  workload produced a Linux write page fault on a mapped shared page
- Next action: decide whether Gate 11 may include the SMP shared-writable-page
  compatibility work or must report scaled Ginux cells as unsupported

## Current repository state

Local and remote `main` identify commit `1852455`. The first ten
feedback-hardening gates passed and closed under delegated review on
`codex/feedback-hardening`; Gate 11 adds measurement-only qualification to the
same branch and PR.
The ordinary QEMU path defaults to two vCPUs; the complete one/two/four-vCPU
matrix and repeated stress pass. The final qualification report and raw/reduced
evidence are under `docs/feedback-hardening/`. No push or merge was performed.

## Open decisions

- Completing the scaled 2- and 4-thread Ginux cells requires correcting shared
  writable mappings across runtime CPUs. That is distinct from the authorized
  futex correction and expands the current measurement gate. Human direction
  is required before implementation.

## Limitations

- The floating upstream Alpine integration image currently stalls at Linux
  user entry on both Gate 5 and pre-Gate-5 commits. Deterministic Linux ABI and
  verification-boot suites pass; external Alpine compatibility is separate
  follow-up work.
- A Gate 7 user-access module extraction passed static and unit checks but
  failed deterministic QEMU twice and was reverted. Its assembly and Rust
  wrappers remain co-located with exception entry until emitted-code behavior
  can be compared without weakening the gate.

## Durable evidence

The detailed rationale is in
[`docs/FEEDBACK-HARDENING-RESEARCH.md`](../docs/FEEDBACK-HARDENING-RESEARCH.md).
Gate 1 evidence is in
[`docs/feedback-hardening/GATE-1-BASELINE.md`](../docs/feedback-hardening/GATE-1-BASELINE.md).
The authoritative execution state and gate outcomes are the files under this
`hdae/` directory.
Gate 10 evidence and final limits are in
[`docs/feedback-hardening/GATE-10-QUALIFICATION.md`](../docs/feedback-hardening/GATE-10-QUALIFICATION.md).
