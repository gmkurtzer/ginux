# Ginux

Ginux is an immutable, capability-secure, container-native operating system for AI infrastructure. The native host is intentionally small: an immutable kernel boots one constrained control-plane domain, which creates isolated services and containers through stable interfaces.

The initial executable milestone is an x86-64 unified EFI image tested under QEMU. Its boot component passes a development-signed authority manifest and measured control-plane bundle, exits firmware boot services, and transfers control to a separate `no_std` kernel. The kernel establishes protected CPU and memory state, seals manifest-derived capabilities into one native domain, and runs the measured W^X control-plane payload at ring 3 through a capability-checked call gate. Calibrated APIC one-shots preempt the control context to run an isolated service and its replacement generation, while bounded IPC carries the request and reply. The control plane can also create, bounded-load, stage, cancel, and retire stop-only auxiliary workloads without placing third-party code in the kernel. A separate isolated service probes and configures link, IPv4, default-gateway, and one static-route record through the first manifest-authorized network-device contract in control ABI v2; a monotonic generation makes effective configuration changes observable and rejects stale whole-state applies. Distinct read-only and write-only services prove that observation and mutation authority can be delegated independently, and a faulted network service is retired without losing mediated state or panicking the kernel. Packet I/O and a general route table remain deliberately unimplemented. On Apple Silicon development hosts it uses QEMU TCG emulation. The same Q35/OVMF profile will use KVM acceleration on x86-64 Linux.

M4 begins with a strict static x86-64 ELF64 parser profile. It scans up to six
program headers in any order, normalizes executable, optional read-only, and
writable loads,
and accepts validated optional `PT_PHDR`, `PT_GNU_RELRO`, and non-executable
`PT_GNU_STACK` declarations. The profile is validated during boot,
plans and installs up to two RX/RW pages per segment with independently
zero-filled BSS, including ELF and program headers in the first load page. The
runtime proof owns every mapped frame, preserves per-page W^X permissions, and
rejects larger plans. The planner materializes a conventional third read-only
load and non-page-base segments. The mapper owns its frame and a separate leaf
table, activates the root, and executes the toolchain-linked image through the
full syscall workload before tearing every frame down. The synthetic two-load
proof also activates the collision-checked page-table root and
executes a non-page-base verification entry at ring 3. This
entry receives a distinct RW/NX stack containing `argc`, `argv[0]`, `envp[0]`,
and bounded Linux `AT_PHDR`/`AT_PHENT`/`AT_PHNUM`/`AT_PAGESZ`, `AT_CLKTCK`,
`AT_PLATFORM`, conservative `AT_HWCAP`/`AT_HWCAP2`, static-loader,
credential, `AT_SECURE`, `AT_EXECFN`, and `AT_ENTRY` metadata. It validates its
argument, environment, executable-name, secure-mode, and entry metadata from
ring 3 before terminating through the architectural x86-64 `SYSCALL` instruction
after checking that an unsupported call returns `-ENOSYS`, performing bounded
console `write` copy-in and `uname` copy-out operations, and validating a
`getpid()` result returned through `SYSRETQ`. Console writes accept 1 through
256 validated bytes on descriptor 1 and preserve exact byte content. Bounded
`writev` atomically validates and assembles up to four vectors under the same
aggregate limit before emitting any bytes. A bounded console ioctl reports a
fixed 80-by-24 geometry, and `close` irreversibly retires either initial console
descriptor for the process lifetime. It also
configures and queries an FS-relative
TLS base through bounded `arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS)` and restores the supervisor's
prior FS base afterward. Pointer-bearing calls are constrained to the RW
segment's declared ELF memory extent or allocated heap bytes below the current
break, plus the mapped user stack. They cannot cross the stack's guard-page
boundaries. Invalid ranges and write arguments return Linux `-EFAULT`,
`-EBADF`, or `-EINVAL`.
Copy-in may also read the declared RX ELF extent, while copy-out rejects it.
The ring-3 workload verifies each error and continues into valid calls.
The bounded process reports UID, effective UID, GID, and effective GID zero as
container-local identity only; these values grant no native kernel capability.
Real/effective/saved UID and GID triples are also zero and are copied only
after all three output pointers pass writable-VMA validation.
Its initial single thread reports PID/TID/process-group/session ID 1 and parent
PID 0, matching an initial process namespace. A bounded
`set_tid_address` registration returns TID 1 and clears the registered word as
part of exit.
Bounded `set_robust_list` and `get_robust_list` calls retain and report one
24-byte thread robust-list head, reject foreign process IDs and invalid ranges,
and discard the registration during exit. Futex recovery is not implemented.
Bounded `mprotect` can irreversibly seal the page named by the parsed
`PT_GNU_RELRO` range as read-only/NX. The page-table permission and syscall copy
direction change together: reads continue, writes fail, and executable
permissions are rejected.
One separately owned, zero-filled RW/NX page backs a bounded `brk` heap. The
ring-3 workload grows and shrinks the break, writes through the mapping, and
confirms that an out-of-range request leaves the current break unchanged.
The initial filesystem view exposes only a working-directory identity of `/`;
bounded `getcwd` returns it, while undersized and invalid buffers fail.
Its first procfs-compatible identity is `/proc/self/exe`, whose bounded
`readlink` result is `/init`.
Per-process `umask` state starts at `022`, returns its prior value, and masks
updates to the nine permission bits.
Bounded `fstat` identifies descriptors 0 and 1 as fixed character devices and
copies the exact x86-64 stat layout only after validating the complete output.
Read-only `getrlimit` and `prlimit64` queries expose the bounded stack and file
descriptor ceilings; unsupported resources, foreign PIDs, mutations, and
invalid output ranges fail without changing user memory.
Bounded `sched_getaffinity` and `getcpu` report the current bootstrap topology
as CPU 0 in NUMA node 0, with atomic validation of their output ranges.
This is not yet a general Linux
process or syscall environment; see

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Rust 1.99.0 through `rustup`
- Clang with the `x86_64-none-elf` assembly target
- QEMU with x86-64 and OVMF support
- GNU Make

Check the local environment:

```sh
make doctor
```

Build the bootable EFI filesystem:

```sh
make build
```

`make build` deterministically regenerates the development manifest, bundle
digest, and Ed25519 signature from `boot/manifest-v0.conf` and
`control-plane/bootstrap.hex`; that source declares its authenticated control,
service, and restart entry labels inline. Run `make manifest` directly when
working on those inputs. The kernel build assembles `kernel/linux-probe.S` as
an x86-64 ELF object, extracts its `.text` section for the executable runtime
proof, and also links a complete static ELF with the Rust toolchain's LLD for
parser compatibility verification. The checked-in linker script fixes its
read-only headers at `0x3ff000`, a two-page RX load with entry at `0x400100`,
and RW data/BSS at `0x402000`, matching the ring-3 workload's bounded layout.
This tests ordinary
linker metadata on both macOS and Linux hosts. `make linux-probe` builds that
artifact directly at `build/linux-probe.elf` for inspection without assembling
the EFI filesystem. Override the tools with `CLANG=/path/to/clang` or
`LLD=/path/to/rust-lld`. Kernel and
proof-workload ABI constants share the machine-readable
`specs/abi/control-v2.rs` source, and the manifest builder expands its symbolic
feature and descriptor words before signing. The checked-in key is an RFC test
identity and must not be treated as a production trust root.

The result is placed at:

```text
build/esp/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
```

Boot it in headless QEMU:

```sh
make run
```

Run the automated boot assertion:

```sh
make test
```

The test succeeds only after the post-firmware kernel validates the UEFI memory map and emits `GINUX_KERNEL_OK` over the serial console.

Before committing a milestone, run the complete clean gate:

```sh
make gate
```

This formats the workspace, removes prior artifacts, runs lint checks, rebuilds
the EFI image, executes the QEMU boot assertions, and checks the working diff
for whitespace errors.

`make help` lists all supported development targets.

## Virtualization profiles

- **macOS on Apple Silicon:** QEMU x86-64 with TCG. UTM is optional for graphical inspection; the checked-in QEMU runner is authoritative.
- **Linux on x86-64:** QEMU x86-64 with KVM when `/dev/kvm` is available, falling back to TCG otherwise.

Override discovery when necessary:

```sh
QEMU_ACCEL=tcg QEMU_CPU=qemu64,+smep,+smap,+umip OVMF_CODE=/path/to/OVMF_CODE.fd OVMF_VARS=/path/to/OVMF_VARS.fd make run
```

The default virtual CPU is `qemu64,+smep,+smap,+umip`, matching the kernel's
fail-closed supervisor execution/access and user-mode instruction protection
requirements. `QEMU_CPU` may select a different model only if it still
advertises SMEP, SMAP, and UMIP.
